/**
 * Simulation: self-avoiding random walk
 * Write a simulation program to show that the chance of getting dead-end paths increases as the grid size increases. 
 * Your program simulates lattices with size from 10 to 80. 
 * For each lattice size, simulate a self-avoiding random walk 10,000 times and display the probability of the dead-end paths, as shown in the following sample output:
