/**
 * Two movable vertices and their distances
 * Write a program that displays two circles with radius 10 at location (40, 40) and (120, 150) with a line connecting the two circles, as shown in Figure 15.28b. 
 * The distance between the circles is displayed along the line. 
 * The user can drag a circle. When that happens, the circle and its line are moved and the distance between the circles is updated.
