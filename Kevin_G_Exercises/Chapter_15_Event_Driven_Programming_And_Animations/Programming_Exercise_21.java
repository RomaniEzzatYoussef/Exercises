/**
 * Drag points
 * Draw a circle with three random points on the circle. 
 * Connect the points to form a triangle. 
 * Display the angles in the triangle. 
 * Use the mouse to drag a point along the perimeter of the circle. 
 * As you drag it, the triangle and angles are redisplayed dynamically, as shown in Figure 15.30b. 
 * For computing angles in a triangle, see Listing 4.1.
