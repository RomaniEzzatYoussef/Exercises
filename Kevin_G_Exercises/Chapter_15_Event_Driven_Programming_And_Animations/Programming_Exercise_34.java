/**
 * Simulation: self-avoiding random walk
 * A self-avoiding walk in a lattice is a path from one point to another that does not visit the same point twice. 
 * Self avoiding walks have applications in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. 
 * They can be used to model chain-like entities such as solvents and polymers. 
 * Write a program that displays a random path that starts from the center and ends at a point on the boundary, as shown in Figure 15.37a or ends at a dead-end point
 * (i.e., surrounded by four points that have already been visited), 
 * as shown in Figure 15.37b. 
 * Assume the size of the lattice is 16 by 16.
