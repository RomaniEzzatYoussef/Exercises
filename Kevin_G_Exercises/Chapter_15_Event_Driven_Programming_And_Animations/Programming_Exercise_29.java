 * Racing car
 * Write a program that simulates car racing, as shown in Figure 15.34a. 
 * The car moves from left to right. When it hits the right end, it restarts from the left and continues the same process. 
 * You can use a timer to control animation. 
 * Redraw the car with a new base coordinates (x, y), as shown in Figure 15.34b. 
 * Also let the user pause/resume the animation with a button press/release and increase/decrease the car speed by pressing the UP and DOWN arrow keys.
