/**
 * Geometry: inside a polygon?
 * Write a program that draws a fixed polygon with points at (40, 20), (70, 40), (60, 80), (45, 45), and (20, 60). 
 * Whenever the mouse is moved, display a message indicating whether the mouse point is inside the polygon at the mouse point or outside of it, as shown in Figure 15.27c. 
 * To detect whether a point is inside a polygon, use the contains method defined in the Node class.
