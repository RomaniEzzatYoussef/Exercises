/**
 * Closest pair of points
 * Section 22.8 introduced an algorithm for finding the closest pair of points using a divide-and-conquer approach. 
 * Implement the algorithm to meet the following requirements: 
 * Define the classes Point and CompareY in the same way as in Programming 
 * Exercise 20.4.
 * Define a class named Pair with the data fields p1 and p2 to represent two points, and a method named getDistance() that returns the distance 
 * between the two points.
 * Implement the following methods:
 * public static Pair getClosestPair(double[][] points)
 * Return the distance of the closest pair of points 
 * public static Pair getClosestPair(Point[] points)
 * Return the distance of the closest pair of points
 * in pointsOrderedOnX[low..high]. This is a recursive
 * method. pointsOrderedOnX and pointsOrderedOnY are
 * not changed in the subsequent recursive calls.
 * public static Pair distance(Point[] pointsOrderedOnX,
 * int low, int high, Point[] pointsOrderedOnY)
 * public static double distance(Point p1, Point p2)
 * public static double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
