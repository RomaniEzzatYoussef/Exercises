/**
 * Geometry: gift-wrapping algorithm for finding a convex hull
 * Section 22.10.1 introduced the gift-wrapping algorithm for finding a convex hull for a set of points. 
 * Assume that the Java’s coordinate system is used for the points. Implement the algorithm using the following method:
 * public static ArrayList<Point2D> getConvexHull(double[][] s)
 * Point2D is defined in Section 9.6. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the set size and the points and displays the points that form a convex hull
