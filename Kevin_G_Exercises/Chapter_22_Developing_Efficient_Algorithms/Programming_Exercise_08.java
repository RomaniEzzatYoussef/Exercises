/**
 * All prime numbers up to 10,000,000,000
 * Write a program that finds all prime numbers up to 10,000,000,000. 
 * There are approximately 455,052,511 such prime numbers. Your program should meet the following requirements:
 * Your program should store the prime numbers in a binary data file, named 
 * PrimeNumbers.dat. When a new prime number is found, the number is appended to the file.
 * To find whether a new number is prime, your program should load the prime numbers from the file to an array of the long type of size 10000.
 * If no number in the array is a divisor for the new number, continue to read 
 * the next 10000 prime numbers from the data file, until a divisor is found or all numbers in the file are read. 
 * If no divisor is found, the new number is prime.
