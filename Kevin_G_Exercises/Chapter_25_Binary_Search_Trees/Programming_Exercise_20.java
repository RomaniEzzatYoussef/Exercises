/**
 * Bin packing using first fit
 * Write a program that packs the objects of various weights into containers. 
 * Each container can hold a maximum of 10 pounds. 
 * The program uses a greedy algorithm that places an object into the first bin in which it would fit. 
 * Your program should prompt the user to enter the total number of objects and the weight of each object. 
 * The program displays the total number of containers needed to pack the objects and the contents of each container.
 * Does this program produce an optimal solution, that is, finding the minimum number of containers to pack the objects?
