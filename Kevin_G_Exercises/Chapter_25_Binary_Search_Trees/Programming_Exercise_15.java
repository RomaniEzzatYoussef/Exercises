/**
 * Parent reference for BST
 * Redefine TreeNode by adding a reference to a node’s parent, as shown below:
 * Reimplement the insert and delete methods in the BST class to update the parent for each node in the tree. 
 * Add the following new method in BST:
 * private TreeNode<E> getNode(E element)
 * private boolean isLeaf(E element)
 * public ArrayList<E> getPath(E e)
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter 10 integers, adds them to the tree, 
 * deletes the first integer from the tree, and displays the paths for all leaf nodes.
