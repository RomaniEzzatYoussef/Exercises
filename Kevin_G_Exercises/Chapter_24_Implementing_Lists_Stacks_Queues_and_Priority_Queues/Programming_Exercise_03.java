/**
 * Implement a doubly linked list
 * The MyLinkedList class used in Listing 24.6 is a one-way directional linked list that enables one-way traversal of the list. 
 * Modify the Node class to add the new data field name previous to refer to the previous node in the list, as follows: 
 * public class Node<E> { E element; 
 * Node<E> next; 
 * Node<E> previous; 
 * public Node(E e) { element = e; } }
 * Implement a new class named TwoWayLinkedList that uses a doubly 
 * linked list to store elements. The MyLinkedList class in the text 
 * extends MyAbstractList. Define TwoWayLinkedList to extend the 
 * java.util.AbstractSequentialList class. You need to implement all the 
 * methods defined in MyLinkedList as well as the methods listIterator()
 * and listIterator(int index). Both return an instance of java.util. 
 * ListIterator<E>. The former sets the cursor to the head of the list and the latter to the element at the specified index.
