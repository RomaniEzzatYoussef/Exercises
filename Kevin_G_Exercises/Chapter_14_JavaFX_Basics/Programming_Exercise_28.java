/**
 * Random time
 * Modify the ClockPane class with three new Boolean properties—hourHandVisible, minuteHandVisible, and secondHandVisible—and their associated accessor and mutator methods. 
 * You can use the set methods to make a hand visible or invisible. Write a test program that displays only the hour and minute hands. 
 * The hour and minute values are randomly generated. 
 * The hour is between 0 and 11, and the minute is either 0 or 30, as shown in Figure 14.52b.
