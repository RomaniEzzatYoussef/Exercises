/**
 * Geometry: two rectangles
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center coordinates, width, and height of two rectangles from the command line. 
 * The program displays the rectangles and a text indicating whether the two are overlapping, whether one is contained in the other, or whether they don’t overlap, as shown in Figure 14.50. 
 * See Programming Exercise 10.13 for checking the relationship between two rectangles.
