/**
 * ComplexMatrix
 * Use the Complex class introduced in Programming Exercise 13.17 to develop the ComplexMatrix class 
 * for performing matrix operations involving complex numbers. The ComplexMatrix class should 
 * extend the GenericMatrix class and implement the add, multiple, and zero methods. 
 * You need to modify GenericMatrix and replace every occurrence of Number by Object, 
 * because Complex is not a subtype of Number. Write a test program that creates the following two matrices 
 * and displays the result of addition and multiplication of the matrices by invoking the printResult method.
