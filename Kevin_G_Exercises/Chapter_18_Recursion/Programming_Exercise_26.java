/**
 * Create a maze
 * Write a program that will find a path in a maze, as shown in Figure 18.13a. 
 * The maze is represented by an 8 * 8 board. The path must meet the following conditions:
 * The path is between the upper-left corner cell and the lower-right corner cell in the maze.
 * The program enables the user to place or remove a mark on a cell. 
 * A path consists of adjacent unmarked cells. 
 * Two cells are said to be adjacent if they are horizontal or vertical neighbors, but not if they are diagonal neighbors.
 * The path does not contain cells that form a square. 
 * The path in Figure 18.13b, for example, does not meet this condition. (The condition makes a path easy to identify on the board.)
