 * Hilbert curve
 * The Hilbert curve, first described by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1891, is a space-filling curve that visits every point in a square grid with a size of 2 * 2, 4 * 4, 8 * 8, 16 * 16, or any other power of 2. 
 * Write a program that displays a Hilbert curve for the specified order, as shown in Figure 18.19.
