/**
 * Koch snowflake fractal
 * The text presented the Sierpinski triangle fractal. 
 * In this exercise, you will write a program to display another fractal, called the Koch snowflake, named after a famous Swedish mathematician. 
 * A Koch snowflake is created as follows:
 * 1. Begin with an equilateral triangle, which is considered to be the Koch fractal of order (or level) 0, as shown in Figure 18.14a.
 * 2. Divide each line in the shape into three equal line segments and draw an outward equilateral triangle with the middle line segment as the base to create a Koch fractal of order 1, as shown in Figure 18.14b.
 * 3. Repeat Step 2 to create a Koch fractal of order 2, 3, . . . , and so on, as shown in Figure 18.14c–d.
