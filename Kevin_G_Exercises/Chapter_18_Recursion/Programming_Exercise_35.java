/**
 * H-tree fractal
 * An H-tree (introduced at the beginning of this chapter in Figure 18.1) is a fractal defined as follows:
 * 1. Begin with a letter H. The three lines of the H are of the same length, as shown in Figure 18.1a.
 * 2. The letter H (in its sans-serif form, H) has four endpoints. Draw an H centered at each of the four endpoints to an H-tree of order 1, as shown in Figure 18.1b. 
 * These Hs are half the size of the H that contains the four endpoints.
 * 3. Repeat Step 2 to create an H-tree of order 2, 3, . . . , and so on, as shown in Figure 18.1c–d.
 * Write a program that draws an H-tree, as shown in Figure 18.1.
