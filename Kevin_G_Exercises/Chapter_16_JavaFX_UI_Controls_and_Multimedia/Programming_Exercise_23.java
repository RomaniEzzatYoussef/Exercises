/**
 * Create an image animator with audio
 * Create animation in Figure 16.46b to meet the following requirements:
 * Allow the user to specify the animation speed in a text field.
 * Get the number of iamges and image’s file-name prefix from the user. 
 * For example, if the user enters n for the number of images and L for the image prefix, then the files are L1.gif, L2.gif, and so on, to Ln.gif. 
 * Assume that the images are stored in the image directory, a subdirectory of the program’s class directory. 
 * The animation displays the images one after the other.
 * Allow the user to specify an audio file URL. 
 * The audio is played while the animation runs.
